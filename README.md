# K-Means Clustering (OpenMP)

This repository contains a simple implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm written in C.

The project includes a sequential version and a parallel version using OpenMP. The goal is to compare execution time and observe the speedup achieved when running the algorithm with multiple threads on a large dataset.

The program reads a CSV dataset, assigns data points to clusters using Euclidean distance, and repeats the process multiple times with different initial centroids to keep the best result.

This project was developed as part of the COE-502: Parallel Processing Architectures course at KFUPM.
